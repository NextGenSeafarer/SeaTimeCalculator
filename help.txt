Short guide/reference for creating Spring boot application step by step:
                                                 made by Pochinskii Ilia

1. App is to be created by reference: https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/
https://start.spring.io/ - is to be used for easy start - up, dependencies in current project:
Spring Web, Thymeleaf

Project: Maven
Lang: Java
Spring Boot: 3.0.2 (or newer)
Project metadata: can be used as needed (java version better 17)


2. Open the project in IDE, maven will upload dependencies in auto mode

3. Make your project, by starting Application it will be deployed to http://localhost:8080/
if it is busy by other project or app, than just go to application.properties and change (or create)
        server.port=80 (or 81 or 82 etc.)
Why to use straight port 80 and not 8080/8081/8082, because later while deploying to the server standard port
for HTTP is 80, so you can access you app without use ip:8080, but just by IP or domain;

Otherwise, I'm using copy of application.properties, named :
application-dev.properties, in IntelliJ IDEA go to Edit configurations -> program arguments -> add : "--spring.profiles.active=dev"
that will use this app.properties once starting local project for tests, and will not affect the original for server itself

4. Time for finding the server VDS/VPS, I'm using the https://timeweb.cloud/ just because it's easy to configure + cheep (3$/month)
In advance buy the domain if needed (or just use free domain given by the timeweb)

5. Configure the server, install Ubuntu as start OS, no any additional framework needs at the moment

6. Install java, because it's empty server by means of:
                        sudo apt install openjdk-19-jdk (19 is just a version, can be changed)
You can use terminal (macOS) in IJ IDEA and make SSH session, passwords and etc. is given by timeweb to you email.
Or use terminal on timeweb website, but it is not comfortable due to no scrolling and no normal copy/paste format

check that java is installed by : java -version it should give something like:

openjdk version "19.0.1" 2022-10-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 19.0.1+10-Ubuntu-1ubuntu122.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.1+10-Ubuntu-1ubuntu122.04, mixed mode, sharing)

7. Go to IJ IDEA -> Maven -> *yourProjectName* -> Lifecycle -> deploy
It will deploy your app to jar file and save in target folder (as default)
If git is not connected to the project, connect it, otherwise just uppload deployedApp.jar to your
repository

8. Create folder on your server by : mkdir application
9. Go to folder by : cd application
10. Use : git clone *link for your github repo*
11. Start your app by : java -jar deployedApp.jar
12. if you can see:
